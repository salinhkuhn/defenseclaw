# internal/gateway — Specification

The gateway package implements a persistent sidecar process that connects
DefenseClaw to the OpenClaw gateway over WebSocket. It provides real-time
event monitoring, exec approval enforcement, skill lifecycle control, and a
local REST API for CLI and plugin integration.

```

The Sidecar runs four independent subsystems as goroutines:

1. **Gateway connection loop** — maintains the WebSocket link with automatic
   reconnection and exponential backoff.
2. **Skill/MCP watcher** — monitors filesystem directories for new skill
   installs and runs the admission gate. Opt-in via config.
3. **REST API server** — exposes `/health`, `/status`, and skill/config
   mutation endpoints on localhost.
4. **LiteLLM guardrail** — spawns and supervises the LiteLLM proxy as a
   child process for LLM traffic inspection. Opt-in via config.

Each subsystem is fault-isolated: a gateway disconnect does not stop the
watcher, API server, or guardrail. Shutdown is coordinated via context
cancellation.

## WebSocket Protocol (v3)

### Connection Handshake

```
Client                              Gateway
  │                                    │
  │──── WebSocket dial ───────────────►│
  │◄─── HTTP 101 Upgrade ─────────────│
  │                                    │
  │◄─── event: connect.challenge ──────│  { nonce, ts }
  │                                    │
  │──── req: connect ─────────────────►│  { protocol, client, role,
  │     (signed device identity)       │    scopes, auth, device }
  │                                    │
  │◄─── res: hello-ok ────────────────│  { protocol, features,
  │                                    │    auth, policy }
  │                                    │
  │     [read loop active]             │
```

1. Client dials `ws://host:port`.
2. Gateway sends a `connect.challenge` event containing a random `nonce`.
3. Client builds a connect request with protocol version, role, scopes,
   auth token, and a device identity block containing the Ed25519 public
   key and a signature over a deterministic v3 payload (see below).
4. Gateway verifies the signature, returns `hello-ok` with negotiated
   features, auth confirmation, and policy (e.g. tick interval).
5. Read loop starts dispatching events.

### Device Authentication

Each sidecar instance has a persistent Ed25519 keypair stored as PEM at
the path configured by `gateway.device_key_file`. On first run, a new
keypair is generated automatically.

The challenge-response signature is computed over a pipe-delimited string:

```
v3|{deviceID}|{clientID}|{clientMode}|{role}|{scopes}|{signedAtMs}|{token}|{nonce}|{platform}|{deviceFamily}
```

The `DeviceID` is the hex-encoded SHA-256 fingerprint of the raw public key.
The signature is base64url-encoded (no padding).

### Frame Types

All frames are JSON objects with a `type` discriminator:

| Type | Direction | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `req` | client → gateway | RPC request (`id`, `method`, `params`) |
| `res` | gateway → client | RPC response (`id`, `ok`, `payload` or `error`) |
| `event` | gateway → client | Broadcast event (`event`, `payload`, optional `seq`) |

Request/response pairs are correlated by UUID `id`. The client maintains a
`pending` map of in-flight request channels; the read loop delivers responses
by matching IDs. Context cancellation cleans up pending entries.

Events carry an optional monotonic `seq` number. The client tracks `lastSeq`
and logs gaps for observability.

### RPC Methods

| Method | Params | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `connect` | protocol, client, role, scopes, auth, device | Initial handshake |
| `skills.update` | `{ skillKey, enabled }` | Enable or disable a skill at the gateway |
| `config.get` | *(none)* | Fetch current gateway configuration |
| `config.patch` | `{ path, value }` | Apply a partial config update |
| `status` | *(none)* | Fetch gateway runtime status |
| `tools.catalog` | *(none)* | Fetch the runtime tool catalog with provenance |
| `exec.approval.resolve` | `{ id, approved, reason }` | Approve or reject an exec request |

### Event Types

| Event | Payload | Handler Action |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `connect.challenge` | `{ nonce, ts }` | Consumed during handshake only |
| `tool_call` | `{ tool, args, status }` | Logged to audit; flagged if tool is `shell`/`exec`/`system.run` with dangerous args |
| `tool_result` | `{ tool, output, exit_code }` | Logged to audit |
| `exec.approval.requested` | `{ id, systemRunPlan }` | Dangerous commands denied; safe commands optionally auto-approved |
| `tick` | *(empty)* | Keepalive, no action |

## Event Router

The `EventRouter` dispatches events received from the gateway read loop.

### Dangerous Command Detection

Tool calls and exec approval requests are scanned for dangerous patterns.
Only tools named `shell`, `system.run`, or `exec` are checked. Detection is
case-insensitive substring matching against a static pattern list:

```
curl, wget, nc , ncat, netcat, /dev/tcp,
base64 -d, base64 --decode, eval , bash -c, sh -c,
python -c, perl -e, ruby -e, rm -rf /, dd if=, mkfs,
chmod 777, > /etc/, >> /etc/, passwd, shadow, sudoers
```

**Tool calls**: flagged events are logged but not blocked (the call has
already been initiated by the agent).

**Exec approvals**: dangerous commands are actively denied via
`exec.approval.resolve` with `approved=false`. Safe commands are
auto-approved when `gateway.auto_approve_safe` is `true`; otherwise the
request is left unresolved (manual approval via the gateway UI).

## Reconnection Strategy

`ConnectWithRetry` implements exponential backoff:

- Initial delay: `gateway.reconnect_ms` (default from config)
- Growth factor: 1.7x per attempt
- Maximum delay: `gateway.max_reconnect_ms`
- Runs indefinitely until context cancellation

The sidecar's gateway loop wraps `ConnectWithRetry` in an outer loop that
also handles post-connection disconnects via the `Disconnected()` channel.
The health tracker transitions through `reconnecting → running → reconnecting`
on each cycle.

## Watcher Integration

When `gateway.watcher.enabled` is `true`, the sidecar starts an
`InstallWatcher` that monitors skill directories via fsnotify. Skill
directories are resolved in order:

1. Explicit `gateway.watcher.skill.dirs` from config
2. Autodiscovered via `config.SkillDirs()` (OpenClaw workspace/global paths)

When the watcher produces an `AdmissionResult` with a `blocked` or
`rejected` verdict for a skill, and `gateway.watcher.skill.take_action` is
`true`, the sidecar calls `client.DisableSkill()` to deactivate the skill
at the gateway level. When `take_action` is `false`, the verdict is logged
but no gateway action is taken.

Non-skill events (e.g. MCP installs) and non-blocking verdicts (clean,
allowed, warning) are ignored by the admission handler.

## LiteLLM Guardrail

When `guardrail.enabled` is `true`, the sidecar spawns a LiteLLM proxy as
a supervised child process. The proxy loads the DefenseClaw guardrail Python
module and inspects all LLM traffic flowing between OpenClaw and the
upstream provider.

### Process Lifecycle

1. **Startup**: `LiteLLMProcess.Run()` locates the `litellm` binary (PATH,
   `~/.local/bin`, `~/.cargo/bin`), verifies the config file exists, then
   starts the process with `--config`, `--port`, and `--detailed_debug` flags.
2. **Environment**: The child process inherits the parent's environment plus:
   - `PYTHONPATH` prepended with the guardrail module directory so LiteLLM
     can import `defenseclaw_guardrail`
   - `DEFENSECLAW_GUARDRAIL_MODE` set to the configured mode (`observe`
     or `action`)
3. **Health check**: A background goroutine polls
   `GET http://127.0.0.1:{port}/health/liveliness` every second. Once it
   returns 200, the health state transitions to `running`. Times out after
   30 seconds.
4. **Output streaming**: stdout and stderr of the LiteLLM process are
   streamed line-by-line to the sidecar's stderr with `[litellm:out]` and
   `[litellm:err]` prefixes.
5. **Crash recovery**: If the process exits unexpectedly, the sidecar
   restarts it with exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → ... → 30s max).
6. **Shutdown**: On context cancellation (SIGINT/SIGTERM), the child process
   is killed via `exec.CommandContext`.

### Guardrail Module

The Python guardrail module (`guardrails/defenseclaw_guardrail.py`) is a
LiteLLM `CustomGuardrail` subclass with two hooks:

- **`async_pre_call_hook`**: Scans prompt messages for injection attacks,
  secrets/PII, and data exfiltration patterns. In `action` mode, raises an
  exception to block flagged prompts.
- **`async_post_call_success_hook`**: Scans LLM responses for leaked secrets
  and inspects tool calls. In `action` mode, raises to block flagged responses.

All inspection is local pattern matching — no network calls in the hot path.
The module reads its mode once from `DEFENSECLAW_GUARDRAIL_MODE` at init.

### Configuration

Settings live under the `guardrail` key in `~/.defenseclaw/config.yaml`:

```yaml
guardrail:
  enabled: false
  mode: "observe"                # observe | action
  port: 4000                     # LiteLLM proxy port
  model: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5"    # upstream model
  model_name: "claude-opus"      # alias exposed to OpenClaw
  api_key_env: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
  guardrail_dir: "~/.defenseclaw/guardrails"
  litellm_config: "~/.defenseclaw/litellm_config.yaml"
  original_model: ""             # saved for revert on disable
```

### Setup and Teardown

Managed via the Python CLI:

- `defenseclaw setup guardrail` — interactive wizard that configures the
  guardrail, generates `litellm_config.yaml`, copies the guardrail module,
  and patches `openclaw.json` to route through LiteLLM.
- `defenseclaw setup guardrail --disable` — reverts `openclaw.json` to the
  original model and sets `guardrail.enabled = false`.

## REST API

The API server binds to `127.0.0.1:{gateway.api_port}` (localhost only).
All responses are `application/json`.

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/health` | GET | Subsystem health snapshot (gateway, watcher, API states + uptime) |
| `/status` | GET | Health snapshot + gateway hello payload (if connected) |
| `/skill/disable` | POST | Disable a skill at the gateway. Body: `{ "skillKey": "..." }` |
| `/skill/enable` | POST | Enable a skill at the gateway. Body: `{ "skillKey": "..." }` |
| `/config/patch` | POST | Patch gateway config. Body: `{ "path": "...", "value": ... }` |

Skill and config endpoints proxy RPCs through the connected gateway client.
If the gateway is not connected, they return `503 Service Unavailable`. If
the gateway rejects the RPC, they return `502 Bad Gateway`. All mutations
are logged to the audit store.

## Health Tracking

`SidecarHealth` is a thread-safe (RWMutex) state machine tracking four
subsystems independently:

| Subsystem | States |
|-----------|--------|
| Gateway | starting → reconnecting → running → error → stopped |
| Watcher | starting → running → disabled → error → stopped |
| API | starting → running → error → stopped |
| Guardrail | disabled → starting → running → error → stopped |

Each state transition records a timestamp (`Since`) and optional error
message / details map. The `Snapshot()` method returns a consistent
point-in-time view including uptime.

## Configuration

All gateway settings live under the `gateway` key in
`~/.defenseclaw/config.yaml`:

```yaml
gateway:
  host: "127.0.0.1"
  port: 18789
  token: ""                    # OpenClaw auth token
  device_key_file: "~/.defenseclaw/device.key"
  auto_approve_safe: false     # auto-approve non-dangerous exec requests
  reconnect_ms: 2000           # initial reconnect delay
  max_reconnect_ms: 30000      # max reconnect delay
  approval_timeout_s: 30       # unused in v1 (reserved)
  api_port: 18790              # local REST API port
  watcher:
    enabled: false
    skill:
      enabled: true
      take_action: false       # disable skills at gateway on block/reject
      dirs: []                 # explicit dirs override autodiscovery
```

## Concurrency Model

- **Read loop**: single goroutine per connection, reads WebSocket frames
  and dispatches to pending channels (responses) or `OnEvent` callback
  (events). Terminates on read error or connection close.
- **Pending requests**: `sync.Mutex`-protected map of `id → chan`. Write
  path registers a channel, sends the frame, and blocks on the channel or
  context cancellation. Read loop delivers by ID lookup.
- **Disconnect signaling**: `sync.Once`-guarded channel close. Both the
  read loop (on error) and `Close()` call `signalDisconnect()`.
- **Health tracker**: `sync.RWMutex` protects all three subsystem states.
  Writers take exclusive lock; `Snapshot()` takes read lock.
- **Sidecar subsystems**: four independent goroutines coordinated by a
  shared context and `sync.WaitGroup`. First error is captured via a
  buffered channel.
- **LiteLLM child process**: spawned via `exec.CommandContext` — context
  cancellation sends SIGKILL. Stdout/stderr streamed via separate goroutines.

## Testing

Tests are split across two files:

- `gateway_test.go` — unit tests for health, frames, device identity,
  dangerous pattern detection, client helpers, and API handler error paths.
  No external dependencies.
- `gateway_ws_test.go` — integration tests using a mock WebSocket server
  (`httptest.Server` + gorilla/websocket upgrader) that simulates the full
  v3 handshake. Covers the connect flow, all RPC methods, approval routing,
  API success paths, and sidecar admission result handling.

Run with: `make gateway-test` or `go test -race ./internal/gateway/`
